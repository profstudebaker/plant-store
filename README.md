# Context Example

The styles and aesthetic in this example leave something to be desired - apologies! In this repo we demonstrate how creating Contexts for data that is accessed in several components throughout your app can simplify the process of passing data to child components. Instead of passing props down the tree (called prop drilling) we can simply import our useContext hooks and access or update the values.

This demo uses a houseplant ecommerce store to show how to implement a context for both the logged in user and their cart, and all of the houseplants for sale on the platform.
